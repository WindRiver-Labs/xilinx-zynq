3. u-boot
=========

Customers can achieve u-boot source code with below command, and then build
it with cross-compile tool by themselves. Different board with different configure file.
	# git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx

In wrlinux production, there is a layer named xilinx-zynq-dl for storing u-boot repository.When
build BSP xilinx-zynq, u-boot will be built and generate one instance for zc702 board. If customers
want to build u-boot for other platform, please modify variable "UBOOT_MACHINE" to corresponding
configure file in xilinx-zynq.conf


4. BOOT.bin Construction
========================

	-----------------------------------------
	|	FSBL(first stage bootloader)	|
	-----------------------------------------
	|	Bitstream(FPGA design)		|
	-----------------------------------------
	|	u-boot				|
	-----------------------------------------


5. Generate BOOT.bin
====================

It is recommend to use the binary files in bootloader/zc702&zc706 directory.
But if customers want to build BOOT.bin themselves, please refer to below:

- https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2018_1/SDK_Doc/SDK_tasks/task_creatingabootimage.html
  It is used to generate a bootload loader without HDMI feature.

- https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/software/linux/zynq_2014r2
  It is used to generate a bootload loader with HDMI feature.
